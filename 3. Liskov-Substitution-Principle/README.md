### what is Liskov Substitution Principle?
- Liskov Substitution Principle states that object of super class should as a ability to replace a object of subclass.
- A Subclass can enchance base class functionality but should not can't reduce base class functionality.
- The simplest way to apply LSP is to implement just extend the super class from derived class without replacing the functionality of super class.
