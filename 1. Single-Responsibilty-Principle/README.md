### What is Single Responsibilty Principle?
- As per Single Responsibilty Principle "A class should have only one reason to change" which mean ...
- Every module or class should have responsibility over a single part of the functionality provided by the software, and that responsibility should be entirely encapsulated by the class.
##### Using SRP, we can achieve:
      1. Each class and module should focus on a single task at a time
      2. Everything in the class should be related to that single purpose
      3. There can be many members in the class as long as they related to the single responsibility
      4. With SRP, classes become smaller and cleaner

### Advantages:
- Maintainability
- Testability
- Flexibility and Extensibility
- Parallel Development
- Loose Coupling
