- One larger interface need to be split to many smaller and relevant interfaces so that implmentation class use only relevant interface.

### Why we need ISP? What happens if not followed?
- End up testing the entire functionality
- Reduce reuseability
- Tight coupling
- Maintenance overheads increase on the classes
- Decrease readability

### Advantages:
- Maintainability
- Testability
- Flexibility and Extensibility
- Loose Coupling
