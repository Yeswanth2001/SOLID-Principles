### What is Open Closed Principle
- Open Closed Principle states that "Software entities such as classes, modules, functions, etc. should be open for extension, but closed for modification" which mean ...
- Any new functionality should be implemented by adding new classes, attributes and methods, instead of changing the current ones or existing ones.
- The simplest way to apply OCP is to implement the new functionality on new derived classes.

### Why we need OCP? What happens if not followed?
- End up testing the entire functionality
- QA Team need to test the entire flow
- Costly Process for the Organization
- Breaks the Single responsibility as well
- Maintenance overheads increase on the classes

### Advantages:
- Maintainability
- Testability
- Flexibility and Extensibility
- Loose Coupling
