### What is SOLID Principles?
- SOLID Principles are design principle provide guidelines and best practices for creating well-structured, maintainable and scalable code.
- These design principle that enable us manage most of the software design problems.
##### The term SOLID is an acronym for five design principles:
        S : Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) 
        O : Open closed Principle (OSP) 
        L : Liskov substitution Principle (LSP) 
        I : Interface Segregation Principle (ISP) 
        D : Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)

### If we donâ€™t follow SOLID Principles we  
1. End up with tight or strong coupling of the code with many other modules/applications
2. Tight coupling causes time to implement any new requirement, features or any bug fixes and some times it creates unknown issues
3. End up with a code which is not testable
4. End up with duplication of code
5. End up creating new bugs by fixing another bug
6. End up with many unknown issues in the application development cycle

### Following SOLID Principles helps us to  
1. Reuse code, Extensibility (easier to add new feature) and increase readability
3. High quality code and few bugs
4. Achieve Better testability
5. Reduce tight coupling
