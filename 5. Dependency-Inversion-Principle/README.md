### What is Dependency Inversion Principle?
- Dependency Inversion Principle states that high-level modules should not depend on low-level modules, but both should depend on abstractions.
- And also, Abstractions should not depend on details.. details should depend on abstractions.
- This Principle encourages the use of interfaces or abstract classes for interaction between high level and low level modules, allowing for greater flexibility and decoupling in the design.

### Why we need DIP? What happens if not followed?
- Tight coupling
- Maintenance overheads increase on the classes
- Reduce Extensibility & readability

### Advantages:
- Maintainability
- Testability
- Flexibility and Extensibility
- Loose Coupling
